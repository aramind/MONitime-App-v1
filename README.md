## About The Project

During my immersive experience in a full stack web development bootcamp, I
embarked on building this remarkable project. Its primary objective was to apply
the extensive knowledge and skills acquired throughout the bootcamp, with a
particular focus on honing my proficiency in the React.js framework. Notably,
this project stands as a testament to the power of client-side development, as
it operates without the need for a dedicated backend infrastructure. Despite
this, I ensured that data persistence was achieved seamlessly through the
utilization of the browser's local storage capabilities.

### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
